![example workflow](https://github.com/jimblandy/perf-event/actions/workflows/master.yml/badge.svg)

*This is a nascent project. Tests are lacking. The design may change.*

This repository holds the source code for the [`perf_event`][pe] and
[`perf_event_open_sys`][peos] crates, which provide access to
performance monitoring hardware and software on Linux.

See the crates' subdirectories for details.
